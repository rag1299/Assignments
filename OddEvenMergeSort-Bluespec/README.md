Step1 : Change input size in the python file

	inputSize = 32 # make sure the size is power of 2
	bitSize = 8 # make sure bitsize is power of 2
	verbose = 0 # make it 1 to show debugging output

Step2 : By default, 32 input bsv file is created and compiled
	
	if you want to run it ,run >>  "./mkMergeSort -m 1500" in terminal

Step3 : if you want to compile and run with manual input size(i.e power of 2)

Change inputsize as mentioned in the step1
open terminal and run the below commands

	cd /path/to/python/file
	python3 MergeSort.py

(make run command automatically be executed in the python file itself)
